# Prototype-Toolboxes
These two toolboxes consist our audio analysis toolkit and our neural toolkit.
DemoAudio demonstrates how to use one of our audio functions based on the pyAudioAnalysis system. It shows the frame energy value of a vocal clip of three greek words as a graph.
DemoMNE shows how to use on of our fNIRS processing functions works. It displays the results in micrometers to several differnt signal enhancments on an fNIRS file, showing the options available graphicaly.
